            <S.Description>I am a software engineer who is an attentive learner and unafraid to take initiative, especially in a team environment. While working under a startup, I took the responsibility to unify a codebase by replacing inconsistent CSS with styled components, improving readability and reducing the lines of code from 6000+ down to 5000. Mindful of my clientsâ€™ needs, I developed a business website that displays an interactive menu, incorporates responsive web and mobile features, and boasts a lighthouse score of 94.</S.Description>
            <S.Description>I strive to utilize my skill set to improve and succeed as a developer, focusing on adaptability and delivering organized, dependable front-end applications. You can view some of these projects in detail below.</S.Description>
